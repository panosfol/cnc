= Config Module

The Config module is responsible for managing the application's configuration. It reads configuration from an `.ini` file and stores it in a `config_t` structure. The configuration includes settings for PostgreSQL and SMTP.

== Configuration File

The configuration is stored in an `.ini` file. This file is divided into sections, each representing a different part of the configuration. Here's an example:

[source,ini]
----
[postgres]
enabled = true
origin_host = localhost
origin_user = user
origin_password = password
origin_port = 5432
origin_db = database

[smtp]
username = user
password = password
smtp_host = smtp.example.com
smtp_port = 587
auth_mode = login
----

In this example, the `[postgres]` section contains the configuration for PostgreSQL, and the `[smtp]` section contains the configuration for SMTP.

== config_t Structure

The `config_t` structure holds the application's configuration. It includes fields for PostgreSQL and SMTP configuration:

[source,c]
----
typedef struct {
    postgres_t *postgres;
    smtp_t *smtp;
} config_t;
----

The `postgres_t` and `smtp_t` structures represent the PostgreSQL and SMTP configuration, respectively.

== Accessing the Configuration

The configuration is stored in a global `config_t` variable. You can access this variable to read the configuration:

[source,c]
----
extern config_t *config;
----

For example, to get the PostgreSQL username, you would use `config->postgres->origin_user`.

== Updating the Configuration

To update the configuration, you need to modify the `.ini` file and restart the application. The Config module will read the new configuration when the application starts.
